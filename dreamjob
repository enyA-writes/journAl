im in the point in life now that i dont know what to do. something is off. im not happy at all. i know i should be grateful of all the things i have and i am. but for the past few years of planning on what will i do with my life, there something wrong that i did. i dont know what or if there is. because i did survive so its for sure correct. is that life is all about? i realised i was just surviving. i wasnt living. 

got a job that pays enough. i was able to buy things that i want. but it is still not the same as having that job that ive always wanted ever since i was a kid. that job that doesnt feel like im working. that job that gives me fulfillment and happiness. that job that makes me happy when im down. i dont really know. im just going to trust faith and destiny. if that job is really for me. 

we all have that job that we always wanted but we could not get due to it being a low-paying job, or whatever stupid reason people made up.
